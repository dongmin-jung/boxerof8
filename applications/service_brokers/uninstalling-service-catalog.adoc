[IMPORTANT]
====
Starting in {product-title} 4.4, the `service-catalog-controller-manager` and
`service-catalog-apiserver` cluster Operators are now set to
`Upgradeable=false`. This means that they will block future cluster upgrades to
the next minor version, for example 4.5, if they are still installed at that
time. Upgrading to z-stream releases such as 4.4.z, however, are still permitted
in this state.
====

You can uninstall Service Catalog if you have installed it previously. Service
Catalog must be removed before the cluster can upgrade to future minor versions
of {product-title}.
