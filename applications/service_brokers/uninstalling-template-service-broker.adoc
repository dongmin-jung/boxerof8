You can uninstall the {tsb-name} if you no longer require access to the template
applications that it provides.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {tsb-name} is deprecated in {product-title} 4. Equivalent and better
functionality is present in the Operator Framework and Operator Lifecycle
Manager (OLM).

[NOTE]
====
By default, the Samples Operator handles Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)-based
{product-title} imagestreams and {product-title} templates. See
xref:../../openshift_images/configuring-samples-operator.adoc#configuring-samples-operator[Configuring the Samples Operator]
