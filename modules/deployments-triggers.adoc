= Deployment triggers

A DeploymentConfig can contain triggers, which drive the creation of new
deployment processes in response to events inside the cluster.

[WARNING]
====
If no triggers are defined on a DeploymentConfig, a `ConfigChange`
trigger is added by default. If triggers are defined as an empty field, deployments
must be started manually.

=== ConfigChange deployment triggers

The `ConfigChange` trigger results in a new ReplicationController whenever
configuration changes are detected in the Pod template of the DeploymentConfig.

[NOTE]
====
If a `ConfigChange` trigger is defined on a DeploymentConfig, the first
ReplicationController is automatically created soon after the DeploymentConfig
itself is created and it is not paused.

.ConfigChange deployment trigger
[source,yaml]
----
triggers:
  - type: "ConfigChange"

[id="deployments-imagechange-trigger_{context}"]
=== ImageChange deployment triggers

The `ImageChange` trigger results in a new ReplicationController whenever the
content of an imagestreamtag changes (when a new version of the image is
pushed).

.ImageChange deployment trigger
[source,yaml]
----
triggers:
  - type: "ImageChange"
    imageChangeParams:
      automatic: true <1>
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
        namespace: "myproject"
      containerNames:
        - "helloworld"
----
<1> If the `imageChangeParams.automatic` field is set to `false`, the trigger is
disabled.


With the above example, when the `latest` tag value of the `origin-ruby-sample`
imagestream changes and the new image value differs from the current image
specified in the DeploymentConfig's `helloworld` container, a new
ReplicationController is created using the new image for the `helloworld`
container.

[NOTE]
====
If an `ImageChange` trigger is defined on a DeploymentConfig (with a
`ConfigChange` trigger and `automatic=false`, or with `automatic=true`) and the
`ImageStreamTag` pointed by the `ImageChange` trigger does not exist yet, then
the initial deployment process will automatically start as soon as an image is
imported or pushed by a build to the `ImageStreamTag`.
