= Granting the role to a user

This procedure shows how to assign the `monitor-crd-edit` role to a user.

.Prerequisites

* You need to have a user created.
* You need to have the `monitor-crd-edit` role described in "Creating a role for setting up metrics collection" created.

.Procedure

. In the Web console, navigate to *User Management* -> *Role Bindings* -> *Create Binding*.
. In *Binding Type*, select the "Namespace Role Binding" type.
. In *Name*, enter a name for the binding.
. In *Namespace*, select the namespace where you want to grant the access.
. In *Role Name*, enter `monitor-crd-edit`.
. In *Subject*, select *User*.
. In *Subject Name*, enter name of the user, for example `johnsmith`.
. Confirm the role binding. Now the user has been assigned the `monitor-crd-edit` role, which allows him to set up metrics collection for a service in the namespace.
