= Configuring quota synchronization period

When a set of resources are deleted, but before quota usage is restored, a user
might encounter problems when attempting to reuse the resources. The
synchronization time frame of resources is determined by the
`resource-quota-sync-period` setting, which can be configured by a cluster
administrator.

Adjusting the regeneration time can be helpful for creating resources and
determining resource usage when automation is used.

[NOTE]
====
The `resource-quota-sync-period` setting is designed to balance system
performance. Reducing the sync period can result in a heavy load on the master.
