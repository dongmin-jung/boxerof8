= About the {tsb-name}

The _{tsb-name}_ gives Service Catalog visibility into the
default Instant App and Quickstart templates that have shipped with
{product-title} since its initial release. The {tsb-name} can also
make available as a service anything for which an {product-title} template has
been written, whether provided by Red Hat, a cluster administrator or user, or a third-party vendor.

By default, the {tsb-name} shows objects that are globally
available from the `openshift` project. It can also be configured to watch any
other project that a cluster administrator chooses.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {tsb-name} is not installed by default in {product-title} 4.
