[id="serverless-components-serving_{context}"]
== Knative Serving

Knative Serving on {product-title} builds on Kubernetes and Kourier to support deploying and managing serverless applications.

It creates a set of Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs) that are used to define and control the behavior of serverless workloads on an {product-title} cluster.

These CRDs are building blocks to address complex use cases, for example:

* Rapidly deploying serverless containers.
* Automatically scaling pods.
* Viewing point-in-time snapshots of deployed code and configurations.

[id="serverless-components-eventing_{context}"]
== Knative Eventing

Knative Eventing on {product-title} enables developers to more easily declare how components of their system communicate, using an event-driven architecture for serverless applications.
Event-driven architecture is based on the concept of decoupled relationships between event producers and event consumers.

For more information about event-driven architecture, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-event-driven-architecture[What is event-driven architecture?]
