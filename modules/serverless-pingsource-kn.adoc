= Using a PingSource with the `kn` CLI

The following sections describe how to create, verify and remove a basic PingSource using the `kn` CLI.

.Prerequisites

* You have Knative Serving and Eventing installed.
* You have the `kn` CLI installed.

.Procedure

. To verify that the PingSource is working, create a simple Knative
service that dumps incoming messages to the service's logs:
+
----
$ kn service create event-display \
    --image quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display:v0.13.2
----

. For each set of ping events that you want to request, create a PingSource in the same namespace as the event consumer:
+
----
$ kn source ping create test-ping-source \
    --schedule "*/2 * * * *" \
    --data '{"message": "Hello world!"}' \
    --sink svc:event-display
----

. Check that the controller is mapped correctly by entering the following command and inspecting the output:
+
----
$ kn source ping describe test-ping-source
----
+
The output should be similar to:
+
----
Name:         test-ping-source
Namespace:    default
Annotations:  sources.knative.dev/creator=developer, sources.knative.dev/lastModifier=developer
Age:          15s
Schedule:     */2 * * * *
Data:         {"message": "Hello world!"}

Sink:
  Name:       event-display
  Namespace:  default
  Resource:   Service (serving.knative.dev/v1)

Conditions:
  OK TYPE                 AGE REASON
  ++ Ready                 8s
  ++ Deployed              8s
  ++ SinkProvided         15s
  ++ ValidSchedule        15s
  ++ EventTypeProvided    15s
  ++ ResourcesCorrect     15s
----

.Verfication steps

You can verify that the Kubernetes events were sent to the Knative event sink by looking at the sink pod's logs.

By default, Knative services terminate their pods if no traffic is received within a 60 second period.
The example shown in this guide creates a PingSource that sends a message every 2 minutes, so each message should be observed in a newly created pod.

. Watch for new pods created:
+
----
$ watch oc get pods
----

. Cancel watching the pods using Ctrl+C, then look at the logs of the created pod:
+
----
$ oc logs $(oc get pod -o name | grep event-display) -c user-container
----
+
The logs should contain lines similar to the following:
+
----

== Remove the PingSource

You can delete the PingSource and the service that you created by entering the following commands:
----
$ kn delete pingsources.sources.knative.dev test-ping-source
$ kn delete service.serving.knative.dev event-display
----
