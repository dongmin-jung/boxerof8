= Managing Custom Resource status using the k8s_status Ansible module

Ansible-based Operators automatically update Custom Resource (CR)
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#status-subresource[`status` subresources]
with generic information about the previous Ansible run. This includes the
number of successful and failed tasks and relevant error messages as shown:

[source,yaml]
----
status:
  conditions:
    - ansibleResult:
      changed: 3
      completion: 2018-12-03T13:45:57.13329
      failures: 1
      ok: 6

      113] No route to host>'
    reason: Failed
    status: "True"
    type: Failure

    message: Running reconciliation
    reason: Running
    status: "True"
    type: Running
----

Ansible-based Operators also allow Operator authors to supply custom status
values with the
link:https://github.com/fabianvf/ansible-k8s-status-module[`k8s_status`] Ansible
module. This allows the author to update the `status` from within Ansible with
any key-value pair as desired.

By default, Ansible-based Operators always include the generic Ansible
run output as shown above. If you would prefer your application did _not_ update
the status with Ansible output, you can track the status manually
from your application.

.Procedure

. To track CR status manually from your application, update the Watches file
with a `manageStatus` field set to `false`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- version: v1
  group: api.example.com
  kind: Foo
  role: /opt/ansible/roles/Foo
  manageStatus: false
----

. Then, use the `k8s_status` Ansible module to update the subresource. For
example, to update with key `foo` and value `bar`, `k8s_status` can be used as
shown:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- k8s_status:
  api_version: app.example.com/v1
  kind: Foo
  name: "{{ meta.name }}"
  namespace: "{{ meta.namespace }}"
  status:
    foo: bar

== Using the k8s_status Ansible module when testing locally

If your Operator takes advantage of the `k8s_status` Ansible module and you want
to test the Operator locally with the `operator-sdk run --local` command, you must
install the module in a location that Ansible expects. This is done with the
`library` configuration option for Ansible.

For this example, assume the user is placing third-party Ansible modules in the
`/usr/share/ansible/library/` directory.

.Procedure

. To install the `k8s_status` module, set the `ansible.cfg` file to search in
the `/usr/share/ansible/library/` directory for installed Ansible modules:
+
----
$ echo "library=/usr/share/ansible/library/" >> /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
----

. Add the `k8s_status.py` file to the `/usr/share/ansible/library/` directory:
+
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/ocp-release-operator-sdk/master/library/k8s_status.py -O /usr/share/ansible/library/k8s_status.py
