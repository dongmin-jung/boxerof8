= Accessing the metrics of your service

Once you have enabled monitoring your own services, deployed a service, and set up metrics collection for it, you can access the metrics of the service as a cluster administrator, as a developer, or as a user with view permissions for the project.

[NOTE]
====
The Grafana instance shipped within {product-title} Monitoring is read-only and displays only infrastructure-related dashboards.
====

.Prerequisites

* You need to deploy the service that you want to monitor.
* You need to enable monitoring of your own services.
* You need to have metrics scraping set up for the service.
* You need to log in as a cluster administrator, a developer, or as a user with view permissions for the project.

.Procedure

. Access the Prometheus web interface:
+
* To access the metrics as a cluster administrator, go to the {product-title} web console, switch to the Administrator Perspective, and click *Monitoring* -> *Metrics*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Cluster administrators, when using the Administrator Perspective, have access to all cluster metrics and to custom service metrics from all projects.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Only cluster administrators have access to the Alertmanager and Prometheus UIs.
====
+
* To access the metrics as a developer or a user with permissions, go to the {product-title} web console, switch to the Developer Perspective, then click *Advanced* -> *Metrics*. Select the project you want to see the metrics for.
+
[NOTE]
====
Developers can only use the Developer Perspective. They can only query metrics from a single project.
====
. Use the PromQL interface to run queries for your services.
