= Expanding CSI volumes

You can use the Container Storage Interface (CSI) to expand storage volumes after they have already been created.

{product-title} supports CSI volume expansion by default. However, a specific CSI driver is required.

{product-title} does not ship with any CSI drivers. It is recommended to use the CSI drivers provided by
link:https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html[community or storage vendors]. Follow the installation instructions provided by the CSI driver.

{product-title} {product-version} supports version 1.1.0 of the
link:https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec[CSI specification].
