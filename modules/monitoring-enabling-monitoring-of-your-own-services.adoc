= Enabling monitoring of your own services

You can enable monitoring your own services by setting the `techPreviewUserWorkload/enabled` flag in the cluster monitoring ConfigMap.

.Prerequisites

* Make sure you have the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap object with the `data/config.yaml` section.

.Procedure

. Start editing the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap:
+
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

. Set the `techPreviewUserWorkload` setting to `true` under `data/config.yaml`:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    techPreviewUserWorkload:
      enabled: true
----

. Save the file to apply the changes. Monitoring your own services is enabled automatically.

. Optional: You can check that the `prometheus-user-workload` pods were created:
+
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get pod
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
