= Installing Service Catalog

If you plan on using any of the services from the {tsb-name}, you must install
Service Catalog by completing the following steps.

The custom resources for Service Catalog's API server and controller manager
are created by default in {product-title}, but initially have a
`managementState` of `Removed`. To install Service Catalog, you must change
the `managementState` for these resources to `Managed`.

  logLevel: Normal
