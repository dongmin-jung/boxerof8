= Watches file

The Watches file contains a list of mappings from Custom Resources (CRs),
identified by its `Group`, `Version`, and `Kind`, to an Ansible role or
playbook. The Operator expects this mapping file in a predefined location,
`/opt/ansible/watches.yaml`.

.Watches file mappings
[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Field
|Description

|`group`
|Group of CR to watch.

|`version`
|Version of CR to watch.

|`kind`
|Kind of CR to watch

|`role` (default)
|Path to the Ansible role added to the container. For example, if your `roles`
directory is at `/opt/ansible/roles/` and your role is named `busybox`, this
value would be `/opt/ansible/roles/busybox`. This field is mutually exclusive
with the `playbook` field.

|`playbook`
|Path to the Ansible playbook added to the container. This playbook is expected
to be simply a way to call roles. This field is mutually exclusive with the
`role` field.

|`reconcilePeriod` (optional)
|The reconciliation interval, how often the role or playbook is run, for a given
CR.

|`manageStatus` (optional)
|When set to `true` (default), the Operator manages the status of the CR
generically. When set to `false`, the status of the CR is managed elsewhere, by
the specified role or playbook or in a separate controller.

.Example Watches file
[source,yaml]
----
- version: v1alpha1 <1>
  group: foo.example.com
  kind: Foo
  role: /opt/ansible/roles/Foo

- version: v1alpha1 <2>
  group: bar.example.com
  kind: Bar
  playbook: /opt/ansible/playbook.yml

- version: v1alpha1 <3>
  group: baz.example.com
  kind: Baz
  playbook: /opt/ansible/baz.yml
  reconcilePeriod: 0
  manageStatus: false
----
<1> Simple example mapping `Foo` to the `Foo` role.
<2> Simple example mapping `Bar` to a playbook.
<3> More complex example for the `Baz` kind. Disables re-queuing and managing
the CR status in the playbook.

== Advanced options

Advanced features can be enabled by adding them to your Watches file per GVK
(group, version, and kind). They can go below the `group`, `version`, `kind` and
`playbook` or `role` fields.

Some features can be overridden per resource using an annotation on that Custom
Resource (CR). The options that can be overridden have the annotation specified
below.

section.
