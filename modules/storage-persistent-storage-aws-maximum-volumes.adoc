[id="maximum-number-of-ebs-volumes-on-a-node_{context}"]
= Maximum Number of EBS Volumes on a Node

By default, {product-title} supports a maximum of 39 EBS volumes attached to one
node. This limit is consistent with the
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/volume_limits.html#linux-specific-volume-limits[AWS
volume limits].

{product-title} can be configured to have a higher limit by setting the
environment variable `KUBE_MAX_PD_VOLS`. However, AWS requires a particular
naming scheme
(link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/device_naming.html[AWS
Device Naming]) for attached devices, which only supports a maximum of 52
volumes. This limits the number of volumes that can be attached to a node via
{product-title} to 52.
