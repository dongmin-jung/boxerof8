[id="dockerfile-source_{context}"]
= Dockerfile source

When you supply a `dockerfile` value, the content of this field
is written to disk as a file named *_Dockerfile_*. This is
done after other input sources are processed, so if the input
source repository contains a *_Dockerfile_* in the root directory,
it will be overwritten with this content.

The source definition is part of the `spec` section in the `BuildConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
source:
  dockerfile: "FROM centos:7\nRUN yum install -y httpd" <1>
----
<1> The `dockerfile` field contains an inline Dockerfile that will be built.

.Additional resources

* The typical use for this field is to provide a `Dockerfile` to a
Docker strategy build.
