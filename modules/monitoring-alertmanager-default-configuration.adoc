= Alertmanager default configuration

The default configuration of the {product-title} Monitoring Alertmanager cluster is this:

[source,yaml]
----
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m
route:
  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 12h
  receiver: default
  routes:
  - match:
      alertname: Watchdog
    repeat_interval: 5m
    receiver: watchdog
receivers:
- name: default
- name: watchdog
----

{product-title} monitoring ships with the Watchdog alert, which fires continuously. Alertmanager repeatedly sends notifications for the Watchdog alert to the notification provider, for example, to PagerDuty. The provider is usually configured to notify the administrator when it stops receiving the Watchdog alert. This mechanism helps ensure continuous operation of Prometheus as well as continuous communication between Alertmanager and the notification provider.
