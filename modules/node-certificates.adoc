[id="node-certificates_{context}"]
= Node certificates

[discrete]
== Purpose

Node certificates are signed by the cluster; they come from a certificate
authority (CA) that is generated by the bootstrap process. Once the cluster is
installed, the node certificates are auto-rotated.

[discrete]
== Management

These certificates are managed by the system and not the user.
