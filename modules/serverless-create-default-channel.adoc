= Creating a channel with cluster default configuration

To create a channel using the cluster default configuration set by the cluster administrator, you must create a generic `Channel` custom object.

.Example `Channel` object
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1beta1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: example-channel
  namespace: default
----

When the above `Channel` object is created, a mutating admission webhook adds a set of `spec.channelTemplate` properties for the `Channel` object based on the default channel implementation chosen by the cluster administrator.

.Example `Channel` object with `spec.channelTemplate` properties
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1beta1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: example-channel
  namespace: default
spec:
  channelTemplate:
    apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1beta1
    kind: InMemoryChannel
----

The channel controller will then create the backing channel instance based on that `spec.channelTemplate` configuration. The `spec.channelTemplate` properties cannot be changed after creation, because they are set by the default channel mechanism rather than by the user.

When this mechanism is used, two objects are created, a generic channel, and an InMemoryChannel channel.

The generic channel acts as a proxy that copies its subscriptions to the InMemoryChannel, and sets its status to reflect the status of the backing InMemoryChannel channel.

Because the channel in this example is created in the default namespace, the channel uses the cluster default, which is InMemoryChannel.
