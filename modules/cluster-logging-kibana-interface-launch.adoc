Kibana is a browser-based console to query, discover, and visualize your logs through histograms, line graphs,
pie charts, heat maps, built-in geospatial support, and other visualizations.

.Procedure

To launch Kibana:

. In the {product-title} console, click *Monitoring* -> *Logging*.

. Log in using the same credentials you use to log in to the {product-title} console.
+
The Kibana interface launches. You can now:
+
* Search and browse your data using the Discover page.
* Chart and map your data using the Visualize page.
* Create and view custom dashboards using the Dashboard page.

Use and configuration of the Kibana interface is beyond the scope of this documentation. For more information,
