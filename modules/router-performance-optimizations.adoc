= Router performance optimizations

{product-title} no longer supports modifying router deployments by setting
environment variables such as `ROUTER_THREADS`, `ROUTER_DEFAULT_TUNNEL_TIMEOUT`,
`ROUTER_DEFAULT_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`, `ROUTER_DEFAULT_SERVER_TIMEOUT`, and
`RELOAD_INTERVAL`.

You can modify the router deployment, but if the Ingress Operator is enabled,
the configuration is overwritten.
