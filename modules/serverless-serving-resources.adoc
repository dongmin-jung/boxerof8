= Knative Serving resources

The resources described in this section are required for Knative Serving to be configured and run correctly.

Knative service resource:: The `service.serving.knative.dev` resource automatically manages the whole lifecycle of a serverless workload on a cluster. It controls the creation of other objects to ensure that an app has a route, a configuration, and a new revision for each update of the service. Services can be defined to always route traffic to the latest revision or to a pinned revision.

Knative route resource:: The `route.serving.knative.dev` resource maps a network endpoint to one or more Knative revisions. You can manage the traffic in several ways, including fractional traffic and named routes.

Knative configuration resource:: The `configuration.serving.knative.dev` resource maintains the required state for your deployment. Modifying a configuration creates a new revision.

Knative revision resource:: The `revision.serving.knative.dev` resource is a point-in-time snapshot of the code and configuration for each modification made to the workload. Revisions are immutable objects and can be retained for as long as needed.
Cluster administrators can modify the `revision.serving.knative.dev` resource to enable automatic scaling of Pods in your {product-title} cluster.
