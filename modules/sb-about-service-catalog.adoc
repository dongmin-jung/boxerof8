= About Service Catalog

When developing microservices-based applications to run on cloud native
platforms, there are many ways to provision different resources and share their
coordinates, credentials, and configuration, depending on the service
provider and the platform.

To give developers a more seamless experience, {product-title} includes _Service Catalog_,
an implementation of the link:https://openservicebrokerapi.org/[Open Service Broker API]
(OSB API) for Kubernetes. This allows users to connect any of their applications
deployed in {product-title} to a wide variety of service brokers.

Service Catalog allows cluster administrators to integrate multiple platforms
using a single API specification. The {product-title} web console displays the
cluster service classes offered by service brokers in Service Catalog, allowing
users to discover and instantiate those services for use with their
applications.

As a result, service users benefit from ease and consistency of use across
different types of services from different providers, while service providers
benefit from having one integration point that gives them access to multiple
platforms.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Service Catalog is not installed by default in {product-title} 4.
