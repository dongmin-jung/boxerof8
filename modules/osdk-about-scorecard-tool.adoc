= About the scorecard tool

To validate an Operator, the Operator SDK's scorecard tool begins by creating
all resources required by any related Custom Resources (CRs) and the Operator.
The scorecard then creates a proxy container in the Operator's Deployment which
is used to record calls to the API server and run some of the tests. The tests
performed also examine some of the parameters in the CRs.
