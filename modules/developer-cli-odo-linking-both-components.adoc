+
----
$ odo list
APP     NAME         TYPE          SOURCE                             STATE
app     backend      openjdk18     file://target/wildwest-1.0.jar     Pushed
app     frontend     nodejs        file://./                          Pushed
----


. Link the current front-end component to the backend:
+
----
$ odo link backend --port 8080
 âœ“  Component backend has been successfully linked from the component frontend

Following environment variables were added to frontend component:
- COMPONENT_BACKEND_HOST
- COMPONENT_BACKEND_PORT
