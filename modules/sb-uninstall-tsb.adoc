= Uninstalling the {tsb-name}

The following procedure uninstalls the {tsb-name} and its Operator using the
web console.

WARNING: Do not uninstall the {tsb-name} if there are any provisioned services from it in your cluster, otherwise you might encounter errors when trying to manage the services.

.Prerequisites

* The {tsb-name} is installed.

.Procedure

This procedure assumes that you installed the {tsb-name} into the
`openshift-template-service-broker` project.

. Uninstall the {tsb-name}.
.. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* and select the
*openshift-template-service-broker* project from the drop-down menu.
.. Click *Template Service Broker Operator*.
.. Select the *Template Service Broker* tab.
.. Click *template-service-broker*.
.. From the *Actions* drop-down menu, select *Delete Template Service Broker*.
.. Click *Delete* from the confirmation pop-up window.
+
The {tsb-name} is now uninstalled, and template applications will soon be
removed from the Developer Catalog.

. Uninstall the {tsb-name} Operator.
.. From the *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators* page, scroll or type a keyword into
the *Filter by name* to find the {tsb-name} Operator, then click on it.
.. On the right-hand side of the *Operator Details* page, select *Uninstall
Operator* from the *Actions* drop-down menu.
.. When prompted by the *Remove Operator Subscription* window, optionally select the
*Also completely remove the Operator from the selected namespace*
check box if you want all components related to the installation to be removed.
This removes the CSV, which in turn removes the Pods, Deployments, CRDs, and CRs
associated with the Operator.
.. Select *Remove*. This Operator will stop running and no longer receive updates.
The {tsb-name} Operator is no longer installed in your cluster.

After the {tsb-name} is uninstalled, users will no longer have access to the
template applications provided by the {tsb-name}.
