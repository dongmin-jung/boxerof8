= Alerting rules

{product-title} Cluster Monitoring by default ships with a set of pre-defined alerting rules.

Note that:

* The default alerting rules are used specifically for the {product-title} cluster and nothing else. For example, you get alerts for a persistent volume in the cluster, but you do not get them for persistent volume in your custom namespace.
* Currently you cannot add custom alerting rules.
* Some alerting rules have identical names. This is intentional. They are sending alerts about the same event with different thresholds, with different severity, or both.
* With the inhibition rules, the lower severity is inhibited when the higher severity is firing.
