= Custom Resource Definition (CRD) upgrades

OLM upgrades a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) immediately if it is owned by a
singular Cluster Service Version (CSV). If a CRD is owned by multiple CSVs, then
the CRD is upgraded when it has satisfied all of the following backward
compatible conditions:

- All existing serving versions in the current CRD are present in the new CRD.
- All existing instances, or Custom Resources (CRs), that are associated with the
serving versions of the CRD are valid when validated against the new CRD's
validation schema.
