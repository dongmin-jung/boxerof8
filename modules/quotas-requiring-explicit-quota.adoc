= Requiring explicit quota to consume a resource

If a resource is not managed by quota, a user has no restriction on the amount
of resource that can be consumed.  For example, if there is no quota on storage
related to the gold storage class, the amount of gold storage a project can
create is unbounded.

For high-cost compute or storage resources, administrators might want to require
an explicit quota be granted in order to consume a resource.  For example, if a
project was not explicitly given quota for storage related to the gold storage
class, users of that project would not be able to create any storage of that
type.

.Procedure

To require explicit quota to consume a particular resource:

. Add the following stanza to the master configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    ResourceQuota:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: resourcequota.admission.k8s.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Configuration
        limitedResources:
        - resource: persistentvolumeclaims <1>
        matchContains:
        - gold.storageclass.storage.k8s.io/requests.storage <2>
----
<1> The group/resource to whose consumption is limited by default.
<2> The name of the resource tracked by quota associated with the group/resource to
limit by default.
+
In the above example, the quota system intercepts every operation that
creates or updates a `PersistentVolumeClaim`. It checks what resources understood
by quota would be consumed, and if there is no covering quota for those resources
in the project, the request is denied.
+
In this example, if a user creates a `PersistentVolumeClaim` that uses storage
associated with the gold storage class, and there is no matching quota in the
project, the request is denied.
