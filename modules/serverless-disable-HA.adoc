= Disabling high availability

You can disable HA for Knative Serving components by changing the configuration of the `KnativeServing.spec.highAvailability` field.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not modify any YAML contained inside the `config` field. Some of the configuration values in this field are injected by the {ServerlessOperatorName}, and modifying them will cause your deployment to become unsupported.
