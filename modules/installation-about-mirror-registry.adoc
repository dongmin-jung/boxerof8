= About the mirror registry

You can mirror the contents of the {product-title} registry and the images
that are required to generate the installation program.

The mirror registry is a key component that is required to complete an
installation in a restricted network. You can create this mirror on a bastion
host, which can access both the internet and your closed network, or by using
other methods that meet your restrictions.

Because of the way that {product-title} verifies integrity for the release
payload, the image references in your local registry are identical to the ones
that are hosted by Red Hat on link:https://quay.io[Quay.io].
During the bootstrapping process of installation, the images must have the same
digests no matter which repository they are pulled from. To ensure that the
release payload is identical, you mirror the images to your local repository.
