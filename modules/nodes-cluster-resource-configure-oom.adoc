= Understanding OOM kill policy

{product-title} may kill a process in a container if the total memory usage of
all the processes in the container exceeds the memory limit, or in serious cases
of node memory exhaustion.

When a process is OOM killed, this may or may not result in the container
exiting immediately. If the container PID 1 process receives the *SIGKILL*, the
container will exit immediately. Otherwise, the container behavior is
dependent on the behavior of the other processes.

For example, a container process exited with code 137, indicating it received a SIGKILL signal.

If the container does not exit immediately, an OOM kill is detectable as
follows:

. Access the pod using a remote shell:
+
----
# oc rsh test
----

. The oom_kill counter in `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.oom_control` is
   incremented
+
----
$ grep '^oom_kill ' /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.oom_control
oom_kill 0
$ sed -e '' </dev/zero  # provoke an OOM kill
Killed
$ echo $?
137
$ grep '^oom_kill ' /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.oom_control
oom_kill 1
----

If one or more processes in a pod are OOM killed, when the pod subsequently
exits, whether immediately or not, it will have phase *Failed* and reason
*OOMKilled*. An OOM killed pod may be restarted depending on the value of
`restartPolicy`. If not restarted, controllers such as the
ReplicationController will notice the podâ€™s failed status and create a new pod
to replace the old one.

If not restarted, the pod status is as follows:

----
$ oc get pod test
NAME      READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
test      0/1       OOMKilled   0          1m

$ oc get pod test -o yaml
...
status:
  containerStatuses:
  - name: test
    ready: false
    restartCount: 0
    state:
      terminated:
        exitCode: 137
        reason: OOMKilled
  phase: Failed
----

If restarted, its status is as follows:

----
$ oc get pod test
NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
test      1/1       Running   1          1m

$ oc get pod test -o yaml
...
status:
  containerStatuses:
  - name: test
    ready: true
    restartCount: 1
    lastState:
      terminated:
        exitCode: 137
        reason: OOMKilled
    state:
      running:
  phase: Running
