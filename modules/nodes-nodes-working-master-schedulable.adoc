= Configuring master nodes as schedulable

As of {product-title} 4.2, you can configure master nodes to be
schedulable, meaning that new Pods are allowed for placement on the master
nodes. By default, master nodes are not schedulable. However, if your cluster
does not contain any worker nodes, then master nodes are marked schedulable by
default.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In version {product-version}, the ability to create a cluster that does not have worker nodes is available to only clusters that are deployed on bare metal as a technology preview. For all other cluster types, you can set the masters to be schedulable but must retain worker nodes.
====

You can allow or disallow master nodes to be schedulable by configuring the
`mastersSchedulable` field.
