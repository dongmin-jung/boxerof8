= Topology Manager policies

Topology Manager works on Nodes and Pods that meet the following conditions:

* The Node's CPU Manager Policy is configured as `static`.
* The Pods are in the `Guaranteed` QoS class.

When the above conditions are met, Topology Manager will align CPU
and device requests for the Pod.

Topology Manager supports 4 allocation policies. These policies are set via a Kubelet
flag, `--topology-manager-policy`. The policies are:

* `none` (default)
* `best-effort`
* `restricted`
* `single-numa-node`


[id="topology-manager-none-policy_{context}"]
== none policy

This is the default policy and does not perform any topology alignment.

[id="topology-manager-best-effort-policy_{context}"]
== best-effort policy

For each container in a Guaranteed Pod with the best-effort topology
management policy, kublet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource
availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager stores the
preferred NUMA Node affinity for that container. If the affinity is not
preferred, Topology Manager will store this and admit the pod to the node anyway.

[id="topology-manager-restricted-policy_{context}"]
== restricted policy

For each container in a Guaranteed Pod with the restricted topology
management policy, kublet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource
availability. Using this information, the Topology Manager stores the
preferred NUMA Node affinity for that container. If the affinity is not
preferred, Topology Manager will reject this pod from the node. This will
result in a pod in a Terminated state with a pod admission failure.

[id="topology-manager-single-numa-node_{context}"]
== single-numa-node

For each container in a Guaranteed Pod with the single-numa-node topology
management policy, kublet calls each Hint Provider to discover their resource availability.
Using this information, the Topology Manager determines if a single NUMA Node
affinity is possible. If it is, the pod will be admitted to the node.
If this is not possible then the Topology Manager will reject the pod
from the node. This will result in a pod in a Terminated state with a pod admission
failure.
