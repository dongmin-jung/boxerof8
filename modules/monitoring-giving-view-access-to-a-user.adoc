= Giving view access to a user

By default, only cluster administrator users and developers have access to metrics from your services. This procedure shows how to grant metrics access to a particular project to an arbitrary user.

.Prerequisites

* You need to have a user created.
* You need to log in as a cluster administrator.

.Procedure

* Run this command to give <user> access to all metrics of your services in <namespace>:
+
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view <user> -n <namespace>
----
+
For example, to give view access to the `ns1` namespace to user `bobwilliams`, run:
+
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view bobwilliams -n ns1
----

* Alternatively, in the Web console, switch to the Developer Perspective, and click *Advanced* -> *Project Access*. From there, you can select the correct namespace and assign the `view` role to a user.
